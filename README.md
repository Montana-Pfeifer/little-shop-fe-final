1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm run dev` to start Application.
  1. You'll see in the terminal that the project has opened at "http://localhost:5173/"
run rails s to display BE data (BackEnd, instructions in BE readME: https://github.com/Montana-Pfeifer/solo_little_shop)

### Preview of App:
(Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off. gifs preferred!)

### Context:
This project took 4 days to complete mostly focusing on the requests and displaying coupon data to the FE, so the FE isn't extra just the neccasary functionality.

### Learning Goals:
Learning goals of this project was to properly display coupon requests from your FE to your BE DB

### Wins + Challenges:
Remembering how to display the coupons within the coupon container in the HTML.
figuring out how to change elements on a page ( part 2 of FE tasks) being able to hide and change elements was a good aha and refresher.
